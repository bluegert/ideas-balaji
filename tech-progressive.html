  <p>In the podcast, Balaji talks about an axis with technological progressives on one side, and political progressives on the other side.</p>
  <p>When faced with a problem, political progressives look at politics first for solutions. New laws or subsidies. In contrast, technological progressives look at technology first for solutions.</p>
  <p>Both groups tend to agree on the problems. For instance, road fatalities, COVID-19, and climate change are all problems. But they disagree on the mechanism of change.</p>
  <p>Balaji argues that we should bet more on technology to solve certain problems. Technology is a voluntary vehicle for change.</p>
  <p>Technological improvements are the thing to bet on. Technology has consistently improved over the last hundred plus years. This type of progress, Balaji argues, is more certain than political progress.</p>
  <p>In this light, Balaji introduces the concept of an axis with technological progressives on one side, and political progressives or technological conservatives on the other side.</p>
