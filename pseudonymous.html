  <h1>The Pseudonymous Economy</h1>
  <p>Balaji explains what pseudonymity is, why we would want a pseudonymous economy, how it could work, and how we could build it in this talk:</p>

  <p><strong>Pseudonymity allows you to build up a reputation, while at the same time shielding you from character assassination.</strong></p>
  <p>In his essay on <a href="https://balajis.com/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter/">"How to Gradually Exit Twitter"</a> Balaji said the following about one downside of Twitter being that it is not fully pseudonymous:</p>
  <p>"It was a mistake to use our real names everywhere online, particularly on Twitter. It made us vulnerable to personal and physical attacks. Social media mobs can swarm your real name online and cancel you in real life. Doxxing can heighten the danger by making threats <a href="https://blog.lopp.net/reflections-upon-a-swatting/">materialize in</a> <a href="https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md">meatspace</a>. Pseudonymity is a better default, especially now that we can <a href="http://www.marknagelberg.com/notes-on-the-pseudonymous-economy-balaji-srinivasan/">earn under a pseudonym</a>."</p>
  <p>Pseudonymity would allow us to separate our speaking name and our earning name from our real name. And this would make us less vulnerable to attacks on our reputation. This is important because negative press is essentially an attack on your social network. It could make you lose friends, customers, employees, investors, or your job.</p>
  <p>We have already seen pseudonymity emerge on platforms such as Reddit, Instagram (finstas), and Twitter (e.g. Crypto Twitter) for purposes of communication. Balaji thinks this will now be extended to transactions thanks to blockchain.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So, I think in the medium term we&#39;ll see new kinds of social networks that allowpeople not just to pseudonymously speak, but to earn and trade with each other. That could end up being a major step for online privacy.</p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1046274438247792640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p>Transactions on blockchains can be pseudonymous (most are). The ability to send and receive money pseudonomously would protect your income against  personal</a> attacks</a>.</p>

  <p>In a pseudonymous economy, you may have many different speaking names, and many different earning names.</p>
  <p>Your speaking, earning, and real names would be separated.</p>
