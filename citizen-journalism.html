  <h1>Citizen Journalism (v1)</h1>
  <p>One of <a href="https://1729.com/decentralizing-media/" target="_blank">Balaji's core ideas around decentralized media</a> is Citizen Journalism.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4) You are an expert in something. You have a responsibility as a citizen to do citizen journalism, to share that with the world<br><br>5) The media should not be “guardians of democracy” nor “enemies of the people”. Neither guardian nor enemy, just the people. All citizen journalists.</p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1244417800048762880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p>With citizen journalism, Balaji means individuals outside of institutions taking it upon themselves to write about topics they are experts on.</p>
  <p>Why would we need citizen journalism? Because for certain topics you need a highly technical background to cover them.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why citizen journalism?<br><br>Because the most important news about TikTok came from an individual with a technical background posting on Reddit. <a href="https://t.co/EO8Lnx3ElC">https://t.co/EO8Lnx3ElC</a></p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1282355940134539266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic made the case for citizen journalism even stronger. Many media companies <a href="https://soundcloud.com/paradoxpodcast/balaji-srinivasan" target="_blank">initially dismissed the threat of the coronavirus (30:03)</a>, and made fun of Tech people who took it seriously.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Vox Doctrine<br><br>Media companies are profiting from a crisis they helped create. Vox/Recode dismissed the pandemic, scorned precautions, told you not to wear masks, even attacked philanthrophy!<br><br>Now they&#39;re setting traffic records.<br><br>Need citizen journalism, not corporate media. <a href="https://t.co/54jGxWE3yT">pic.twitter.com/54jGxWE3yT</a></p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1248317804576567296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p>In some cases, citizen journalism <a href="https://1729.com/decentralizing-media/" target="_blank">could literally save lives</a>.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It has also changed my mind on something, or at least changed priority. I now think it is *crucial* that people with scientific &amp; engineering backgrounds (a) engage in citizen journalism and (b) attain political office.<br><br>Can&#39;t do rear-wheel drive anymore. Life or death situation.</p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1249792364253597696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p>Experts in a certain topic should be the ones writing about that topic. We need people with technological backgrounds publishing.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What I’ve realized over the last few weeks is that you can’t give media and political elites an intuition for math and science overnight.<br><br>Purely verbal people tend to discount any kind of exponential projection as unrealistic, *even if* shown data. <a href="https://t.co/QqTXbRmIY0">https://t.co/QqTXbRmIY0</a></p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1235932000609013760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 6, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you have STEM background, going into tech was obvious choice.<br><br>But all those individually rational decisions have leached all technical acumen out of press &amp; state.<br><br>Step 1 in rectifying this: citizen journalism by STEM folks. Takes time, but is needed.<a href="https://t.co/sdYdW7d4KD">https://t.co/sdYdW7d4KD</a></p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1244909925748244480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p>The idea is that citizen journalists publish out of a sense of civic duty.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks. To be fair, this is actually an NYT link! There is good and bad journalism.<br><br>I&#39;ve also been thinking more that it is our *responsibility* to do (eg) a year of citizen journalism each. Otherwise we have a critical deficit of writers with scientific &amp; technical backgrounds.</p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1235615627597012993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That’s the point actually: citizen journalists have a day job. The journalism is part-time, something they do out of a sense of civic responsibility.<br><br>It’s not their personal business model. And so they need not mouth just-the-flu groupthink just to eat. <a href="https://t.co/LDlKac3zID">https://t.co/LDlKac3zID</a> <a href="https://t.co/iL2OaxKTGj">https://t.co/iL2OaxKTGj</a></p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1244435190023241728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p>Because citizen journalists are not dependent on their posts for their income, they can have different incentives than legacy media companies. <strong>Truth and differentiation can be incentivized.</strong></p>
  <p>With regards to truth, citizen journalism would include decentralized factchecking, enabled by <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1211777785460666368?s=20" target="_blank">the ledger of record</a>.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think the second part of citizen journalism is reproducible journalism, based on decentralized fact checking.<br><br>This involves some new culture (citation of all sources, github-style corrections, etc) and some new technology. See this thread for details. <a href="https://t.co/LLNf6daO0H">https://t.co/LLNf6daO0H</a></p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1255686220136370176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crypto oracles will drive this. People are setting up oracles to place bets on everything from average temperatures to arrival times.<br><br>All that data gets fed into public chains, and hashed with cryptographically hard-to-fake timestamps. So you know who wrote what when on chain.</p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1211779156863787013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p>And this is how Balaji argues differentiation will be incentivized:</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">By the way, the Substack model incentivizes writers to differentiate rather than all repeat the same thing.<br><br>That’s good for original writers and bad for centralized narratives.<br><br>Individual monetization, distribution, reputation, content: that’s how we decentralize media.</p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1244425310826725377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  
  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1191445815727984642">The internet turned everyone into publishers</a>. <a href="https://balajis.com/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter/">You can now own your own distribution</a>. And cryptocurrencies enable you to <a href="pseudonymous.html">separate your real name from your income</a>. These are all beneficial developments for citizen journalists.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I believe in citizen journalism for the same reason I believe in the solo developer.<br><br>Satoshi showed what one person can do. So did Snowden.<br><br>In 2013, Snowden needed the help of the (courageous) <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ggreenwald</a>, but the next Snowden could go full stack. Do the whole thing themselves. <a href="https://t.co/7QBAb2sMWo">https://t.co/7QBAb2sMWo</a></p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1281771342807752704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p>The lines between media and citizens are fading. Citizen as journalists, and <a href="company-media.html">every company a media company</a>.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Point being that the concept of the “press” as a entity distinct from the citizenry at large is going away. Every citizen a citizen journalist.<br><br>And just as NYT is becoming a tech company, tech firms are building media arms.
