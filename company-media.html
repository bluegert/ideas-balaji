  <h1>Every Company a Media Company (v1)</h1>
  <p>*Unfinished*</p>
  <p>One of <a href="https://1729.com/decentralizing-media/" target="_blank">Balaji's core ideas around decentralized media</a> is that every company will become a media company.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4) You are an expert in something. You have a responsibility as a citizen to do citizen journalism, to share that with the world<br><br>5) The media should not be “guardians of democracy” nor “enemies of the people”. Neither guardian nor enemy, just the people. All citizen journalists.</p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1244417800048762880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

  <p>In fact, media companies are competitors. Especially to Tech companies.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember: the New York Times Company announced it is becoming a tech company.<br><br>That means it has gotten in the ring. <br>This is not some public trust, it’s a $7B firm aiming for $70B.<br><br>Coke doesn’t help Pepsi.

  <p>On The Realignment podcast Ep. 43 Balaji explained how building your reputation as a company using media companies is analogous to building a company on a platform such as Facebook's API. Watch the video below or read the transcript:</p>

  <p>You do not need the media anymore to grow your company. All the tools to reach an audience are available for everyone on the internet.</p>
  <p>Instead of just marketing, companies are going to be publishing full-stack narratives.</p>
  <p>Every company has a Twitter already</p>
  <p>Netflix and Amazon are already producing their own Hollywood movies</p>
